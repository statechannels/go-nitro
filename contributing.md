# Contributing

Contributions to go-nitro are welcome from anyone.

Magmo (at Consensys Mesh) are developing go-nitro under contract for the Filecoin Foundation. As a consequence, we reserve discretionary veto rights on feature additions, architectural decisions, etc., which may hinder progress toward the specific aims of this contract.

## Contribution lifecycle

Magmo uses [Github Projects](https://github.com/statechannels/go-nitro/projects/1) for go-nitro project management. We will aim to keep a handful of "good first issues" in [the pipeline](https://github.com/statechannels/go-nitro/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), which are a good place to start.

Before spending lots of time working on an issue, consider asking us for feedback via [Slack](https://statechannels.slack.com/archives/C02J81JFD3J), the [issue tracker](https://github.com/statechannels/go-nitro/issues), or [email](magmo@mesh.xyz). We would love to help make your contributions more successful!

Pull requests (internal or external) will be reviewed by one or two members of Magmo. We aim to review most contributions within one business day.

We include a PR template to serve as a **guideline**, not a **rule**, to communicate the code culture we wish to maintain in this repository.

## Style

When in doubt, defer to the [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) document [CodeReviewComments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) as "style guides".

# Debugging Tests

VS code is used to debug tests. To start a debugging session in VS code:

- Ensure you have the [go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go) installed
- Open the test file.
- Open the `Run and Debug` section.
- Run the `Debug Test` configuration.

With the extension it is also possible to start a debugging session right from a test function.

# Generating Go bindings

We use `solc` and `abigen` to generate Go bindings from our `*.sol` source files.

This is achieved by running the `generate_adjudicator_bindings.sh` script at the top level of the repo. Because our `*.sol` files depend on external projects via `node_modules`, to run this script successfully you must:

- have successfully run `npm install` in the `nitro-protocol` directory.
- have [solc](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/installing-solidity.html) installed at the correct version (currently 0.8.17, see the [CI](.github/workflows/bindings-check.yml) or linting config for a hint if you think it may have changed)
- have [abigen](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth) (a tool shipped with go-ethereum) installed. Currently we use version 1.12.2, see the [CI](.github/workflows/bindings-check.yml) for a hint if you think it may have changed.

The resulting Go bindings file is _checked-in_ to the repository. Although it is auto-generated from on-chain source code, it effectively forms part of the off-chain source code.

If you alter the contracts, you should regenerate the bindings file at check it in. A github action will run which will check that you have done this correctly.

TIP: if you find that the github action still reports a mismatch despite regenerating the bindings, this may be due to the action using the "test merge" of your PR (rather than the tip of your branch). Try rebasing your branch.

# Testground

We run deeper tests of the code on your PR using a hosted [testground](https://docs.testground.ai/) runner. You may see a comment appear with links to dashboards containing performance metrics and statistics. The tests may also be run locally. For more information, see our testground [test plan repository](https://github.com/statechannels/go-nitro-testground).

# Logs

Go-nitro uses a configurable logger. It outputs [ndjson](http://ndjson.org/) which is optimized for machine-readability. Integration tests typically write logs from several go-nitro nodes to a single file in the `artifacts` directory.

A typical log line is

```json
{
  "level": "debug",
  "engine": "0x111A00",
  "time": 1681911828835,
  "caller": "engine.go:115",
  "message": "Constructed Engine"
}
```

To make parsing logs easier for humans, install [`pino-pretty`](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-pretty) and do something like:

```shell
cat artifacts/simple_integration_run.log | pino-pretty -S -o "{engine} {To} < {From}" > output.log
```

You may then view `output.log` in VSCode. A typical log line is then:

```log
[14:37:36.517] DEBUG <engine.go:114>: 0x111A00  <  {"engine":"0x111A00","message":"Constructed Engine"}
```

### Start RPC servers with Docker

To test the creation and execution of channels it is necessary to have a test network with multiple nodes.
To spin up a docker image with 3 rpc servers and channels pre-populated, run the following:

1. `make docker/network/build`
2. `make docker/network/start`

Three rpc go-nitro servers will be available on ports 4005, 4006, and 4007 for Alice, Irene, and Bob. A ledger channel is created between Alice and Irene, and another ledger channel is created between Irene and Bob. A virtual channel is created between Alice and Bob.
Each server may be communicated with over JSON-RPC at a localhost endpoint with an appropriate port. See [these instructions](./doc.go) on how to do that.

### Start RPC servers test command

A [test command](./cmd/start-rpc-servers/main.go) is available to start up multiple RPC servers and a test chain. This is used to easily and quickly spin up a test environment. The command requires that `foundry` is installed locally; `foundry` installation instructions are available [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

The command will:

1. Start an `foundry anvil` test chain
2. Deploy the adjudicator contract to the test chain
3. Start an RPC server for Alice (`0xAAA6628Ec44A8a742987EF3A114dDFE2D4F7aDCE`) listening for RPCs on port `4005`
4. Start an RPC server for Irene (`0x111A00868581f73AB42FEEF67D235Ca09ca1E8db`) listening for RPCs on port `4006`
5. Start an RPC server for Bob (`0xBBB676f9cFF8D242e9eaC39D063848807d3D1D94`) listening for RPCs on port `4007`

Stopping the test command will shutdown all RPC servers and `anvil`.

To run the command from the `go-nitro` directory run `go run ./cmd/start-rpc-servers`
