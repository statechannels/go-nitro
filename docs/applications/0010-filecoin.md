# Filecoin

Nitro channels are currently under development for use in the Filecoin ecosystem, with support from the [Filecoin Foundation](https://fil.org/). Efforts are concentrated on two main areas:

## Retrieval Markets

Low latency payments can incentivize retrieval providers to provide files to retrieval clients, without burdening either party with slow transaction confirmation times or high transaction costs. This will faciliate a [decentralized CDN](https://retrieval.market/) for Filecoin.

## Filecoin Virtual Machine

Filecoin is working towards having an [EVM-compatible virtual machine](https://fvm.filecoin.io/). This is a crucial step allowing for Nitro to be implemented in solidity and deployed to Filecoin. This not only enables the retrieval markets application(s), but a whole raft of other applications looking to benefit from the same sweetness that Nitro can bring.
