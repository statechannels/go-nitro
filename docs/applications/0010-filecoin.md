# Filecoin

Nitro channels are currently under development for use in the Filecoin ecosystem, with support from the [Filecoin Foundation](https://fil.org/). Efforts are concentrated on two main areas:

## Retrieval Markets

![Retrieval Markets](https://retrievalmarketssummit.super.site/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsuper-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffcbb1177-a860-41c3-a5d7-b5b00de65076%2Fimages%2F8c19abc9-34d9-49b2-99ee-4be11c9baa5d.png&w=1920&q=80)

Low latency payments can incentivize retrieval providers to provide files to retrieval clients, without burdening either party with slow transaction confirmation times or high transaction costs. This will faciliate a [decentralized CDN](https://retrieval.market/) for Filecoin.

## Filecoin Virtual Machine

Filecoin is working towards having an [EVM-compatible virtual machine](https://fvm.filecoin.io/). This is a crucial step allowing for Nitro to be implemented in solidity and deployed to Filecoin. This not only enables the retrieval markets application(s), but a whole raft of other applications looking to benefit from the same sweetness that Nitro can bring.
