# Web3Torrent

[Web3Torrent](https://web3torrent.statechannels.org) is a proof of concept state channel application powered by Nitro. It shows off the power of virtual channels by allowing seeders to earn from peers in a torrent swarm who download from them. It is built on [webTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/).
