# Nitro Channels

Nitro channels are a technology which allows for **ultra low cost, near-zero latency conditional transfer** of cryptoassets.

They work by allowing users to deposit their funds into a "layer 2" network which sits above a blockchain. This layer 2 network inherits many of the properties of the underlying chain -- for example, **permisionlessness** and the lack of a need to place **trust** in any counterparty.

The network benefits from significant advantages, however -- in a fraction of a second, a direct connection can be forged with anyone else in the network. Then, payments can be streamed incredibly fast: up to **hundreds of times per second**.
