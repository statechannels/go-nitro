# Nitro Channels

Nitro channels are a technology which allows for **ultra low cost, near-zero latency conditional transfer** of cryptoassets.

They work by allowing users to deposit their funds into a "layer 2" network which sits above a blockchain. This layer 2 network inherits many of the properties of the underlying chain -- for example, **permisionlessness** and the lack of a need to place **trust** in any counterparty.

The network benefits from significant advantages, however -- in a fraction of a second, a direct, private connection can be forged with anyone else in the network. Then, payments can be streamed incredibly fast: up to **hundreds of times per second**. What's more, there is no per-payment fee to cover (just a small fee per unit time for maintaining the connection).

This is in sharp contrast to the experience of transacting publicly on a "layer 1" blockchain or even on a rollup chain. There, fees and latency apply to each and every action.
