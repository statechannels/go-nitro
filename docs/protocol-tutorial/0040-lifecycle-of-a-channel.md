# Lifecycle of a state channel

In this section we'll consider the "state" of a state channel as composite of three states -- the [_off chain state_](#off-chain-lifecycle), the on chain [_adjudication state_](#adjudication) and the [_funding state_](#funding-lifecyle) (which can be on or off chain). The off chain parts of the state may be different for each participant in the channel, whereas the on chain part of the state is considered consistent (up to issues to do with finality and chain reorgs).

!!! info

    "State" is a highly overloaded term -- in this section we take it to mean something different from the "state" of [the section on states](./0010-states-channels.md#states) (unless explicitly noted).

## Off-chain lifecycle

The off-chain lifecycle of a channel may be visualized like this:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2

state OffChain {
[*] --> Proposed
 Proposed --> ReadyToFund
 ReadyToFund --> Funded
 Funded --> Running
 Running --> Finalized
}

```

The conditions for each state emerge from the collection of [states](./0010-states-channels.md#states) and [signatures](./0010-states-channels.md#state-commitments) held by each participant. Let's look at each in turn.

### `Proposed`

This state applies as soon as a participant commits to a state with `turnNum=0` known as the **prefund** state. This is typically broadcast to other participants who may countersign it to indicate their agreement to join the channel.

### `ReadyToFund`

This state applies when all participants commit to the **prefund** state, i.e. when all prefund signatures are in hand.

!!! info

    It is important to wait for a supported prefund before depositing any funds on chain, since this state is a guarantee that on chain funds can be unlocked with the intial (prefund) [outcome](./0030-outcomes.md).

### `Funded`

This state applies when all participants commit to a state with `turnNum=1` known as the **postfund** state. Each participant should only make this commitment when one of the following is true:

- sufficient deposits are accrued on chain against the channel in question
- sufficient money is directly allocated to the channel in question from an existing funded channel
- sufficient money is _guaranteed_ to the channel in question from an existing funded channel

For more detail see the section on [funding](./0060-funding-a-channel.md).

### `Running`

This state applies when a state with `turnNum > 1` becomes supported.

### `Finalized`

This state applies when all participants commit to a state with `isFinal=true`, i.e. when all final signatures are in hand.

!!! info

        Each state supercedes the previous ones in the sense that (for example) a channel is said to be `Funded` if it meets that condition, even though it also meets the condition for `ReadyToFund`.

## Funding lifecycle

A channel may be funded _either_ on-chain or off-chain.

The state can be visualized like this:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2


state OnChain {
state Funding {
    [*]-->NotFundedOnChain
    NotFundedOnChain --> FundedOnChain
    FundedOnChain --> NotFundedOnChain
}
}
state OffChain {
state Fundings {
    [*]-->NotFundedOffChain
    NotFundedOffChain --> FundedOffChain
    FundedOffChain --> NotFundedOffChain
}
}

```

### On-chain

When a channel is to be funded on chain, participants follow the [on chain deposit protocol](./0060-funding-a-channel.md#fund-with-an-on-chain-deposit). When sufficient funds are deposited against the channel, the state has transitioned to `FundedOnChain`.

### Off-chain

Funding on chain is often not necessary, since most channels are funded off-chain. In that case, the "funding state" of a channel is composed of the off-chain state of one or more other channels. See the section on [funding](./0060-funding-a-channel.md#fund-from-an-existing-channel).

## Adjudication lifecyle

The adjudicator smart contract (henceforth "adjudicator") is the main on-chain code governing the state channel network. It stores certain information about any channel that it knows about. The off chain state may be submitted to the adjudicator at any time to trigger the adjudication status of a channel to change. The adjudication status of a channel is composed of several variables, but these are summarized in finite states `Open`, `Challenge` and `Finalized` -- these are called [channel modes](#channel-modes).

### Channel Modes

A channel is in one or the other of three modes, which can be represented in the following state machine:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2

state OnChain {
state Adjudication {
Open -->Challenge: challenge
Open --> Open: checkpoint
Open--> Finalized: conclude
Challenge--> Challenge: challenge
Challenge--> Open: respond
Challenge--> Open: checkpoint
Challenge--> Finalized: conclude
Challenge--> Finalized': timeout
}
}
```

Here `Finalized` and `Finalized'` are distinct states reflecting the fact that the on-chain storage is slightly different in each case, although the implications are the same (the channel may now be defunded on chain).

Most of the transitions between states can be understood via the section on [finalizing a channel](./0070-finalizing-a-channel.md). The remaining transition `timeout` is a passive transition which happens when a block is produced with a sufficiently large timestamp.

!!! tip

    Ideally channels are never adjudicated on chain. This only state applies  as a [last resort](./0070-finalizing-a-channel.md#sad-path) when cooperation has broken down.

The channel mode is derived from other [status](#adjudicator-status) data stored on chain using this function:

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Computes the ChannelMode for a given channelId.
     * @dev Computes the ChannelMode for a given channelId.
     * @param channelId Unique identifier for a channel.
     */
    function _mode(bytes32 channelId) internal view returns (ChannelMode) {
        // Note that _unpackStatus(someRandomChannelId) returns (0,0,0), which is
        // correct when nobody has written to storage yet.

        (, uint48 finalizesAt, ) = _unpackStatus(channelId);
        if (finalizesAt == 0) {
            return ChannelMode.Open;
            // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
        } else if (finalizesAt <= block.timestamp) {
            return ChannelMode.Finalized;
        } else {
            return ChannelMode.Challenge;
        }
    }

```

### `finalizesAt`

As you can see, the channel mode is determined by the relation between the timestamp of the current block and the `finalizesAt` timestamp stored on chain. When `finalizesAt` is in the past, the channel is `Finalized`; when it is in the future, the channel is in `Challenge`. When it is (the magic and initial value of ) `0`, the channel is `Open`.

### `turnNumRecord`

`turNumRecord` is the highest turn number that is known to the chain to be supported by a full set of signatures.
The exception to this rule is that it is set to `0` when the channel is concluded via a `conclude` call.

For example, the `turnNumRecord` might be increased by a submitted [`checkpoint` transaction](./0070-finalizing-a-channel.md#call-checkpoint) including a [support proof](./0020-execution-rules.md#execution-rules) for a state.

### `fingerprint`

The `fingerprint` helps to uniquely identify the channel's current state, up to hash collisions. It is computed as:

```solidity
uint160(
        uint256(
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
                    stateHash,  // (1)
                    outcomeHash // (2)
                )
            )
        )
    )
```

1. This is formed according to [this formula](./0010-states-channels.md#state-commitments).
2. This is formed by a simple abi-encode and keccack256 recipe.

## Adjudicator storage

Status data is stored inside the adjudicator in the following mapping (with `channelId` as the key):

```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => bytes32) public statusOf;
```

Generating a 32 byte `status` involves

- setting the most significant 48 bits to the `turnNumRecord`
- setting the next most significant 48 bits to `finalizesAt`
- setting the next most significant 160 bits to the `fingerprint`

When the adjudicator needs to verify the exact state or outcome, the data is provided in the function arguments, as part of the `calldata`. The chain will then check that the hydrated data matches the status that has been stored.

!!! info

    `turnNumRecord` and `finalizesAt` can be read from storage straightforwardly, whereas the other `ChannelData` fields are only stored as the output of a one-way function. The input to this function must therefore be tracked in client code by monitoring the relevant contract events.

We provide a helper function to construct the appropriate status from a javascript representation of `ChannelData`:

```typescript
import {
  ChannelData,
  channelDataToFingerprint,
} from "@statechannels/nitro-protocol";

const channelData: ChannelData = {
  turnNumRecord: largestTurnNum,
  finalizesAt: 0x0,
};
const status = channelDataToStatus(channelData);
```

Here we omitted some of the fields, because the helper function is smart enough to know to set them to null values when finalizes at is zero. We'll be using this helper in the next tutorial lesson.
