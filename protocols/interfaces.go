// Objective is the interface for off-chain protocols.

// 	* It is initialized by a single client (passing in various parameters). It is implicitly approved by that client. It is communicated to the other clients.
// 	* It is stored and then approved or rejected by the other clients
// 	* It is updated with external information arriving to the client
// 	* After each update, it is cranked. This generates side effects and other metadata
// 	* The metadata will eventually indicate that the Objective has stalled OR the Objective has completed successfully
