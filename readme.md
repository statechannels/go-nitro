Implementation of nitro protocol in golang.

---

# Getting started (MacOS)

Install golang

```
brew install golang
```

Install [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run):

```
brew install golangci-lint
brew upgrade golangci-lint
```

Make sure GOPATH is set:

```
echo $GOPATH
```

You should see `$HOME/go`.

### For developers

To format:

```shell
gofmt -w .
```

To lint:

```shell
golangci-lint run
```

To build:

```shell
go build ./...
```

To run tests:

```shell
go test ./...
```

To view docs website:

```shell
godoc --http :6060
```

and navigate to http://localhost:6060/pkg/github.com/statechannels/go-nitro/
To remove unused dependencies (CI checks will fail unless this is a no-op):

```shell
go mod tidy
```

## Roadmap

The following roadmap gives an idea of the various packages that compose the `go-nitro` module, and their implementation status:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ channel ðŸš§                 # query the latest supported state of a channel
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ state âœ…               # generate and recover signatures on state updates
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ outcome âœ…         # define how funds are dispersed when a channel closes
â”œâ”€â”€ client ðŸš§                  # exposes an API to the consuming application
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ engine ðŸš§              # coordinate the client components, runs the protocols
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ chainservice ðŸš§    # watch the chain and submit transactions
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ messageservice ðŸš§  # send and recieves messages from peers
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ store ðŸš§           # store keys, state updates and other critical data
â”œâ”€â”€ protocols ðŸš§
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ interfaces.go âœ…       # specify the interface of our protocols
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ direct-fund âœ…         # fund a channel on-chain
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ direct-defund ðŸš§       # defund a channel on-chain
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ virtual-fund ðŸš§        # fund a channel off-chain through one or more intermediaries
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ virtual-defund ðŸš§      # defund a channel off-chain through one or more intermediaries
â””â”€â”€ types ðŸš§                   # basic types and utility methods
```
